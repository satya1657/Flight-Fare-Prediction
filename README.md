# Flight-Fare-prediction
This is a Machine Learning based prediction model, which predicts Flight ticket prices. We pick data set from the kaggle and do data preprocessing on it.
after that trained a model on training set and deployed on Heroku.

The downloaded data has been processed and stored in final_data.csv file. Final data has been tested and trained on 
various Machine Learning models and the best model with hyperparameter tunning is selected from it. The accuracy of the model is shown in the below image.
